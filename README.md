# Text Summarization Using HuggingFace

## Project Overview
This project involves the development of a text summarization tool utilizing the Hugging Face library to analyze and summarize technological texts and facts. The goal of the project is to explore and implement various models from the Hugging Face Hub to identify the best-performing model for summarizing data. The selected model was fine-tuned to improve its effectiveness in summarizing technical content.

The backend is powered by Flask, while the frontend is designed using HTML and Bootstrap for an intuitive user experience.

## Features
- Summarizes technological texts and facts using state-of-the-art NLP models from Hugging Face.
- Allows users to input custom text for summarization.
- Pretrained a Hugging Face model to tailor the summarization performance to specific data.
- Backend implemented with Flask for handling requests.
- Responsive and user-friendly frontend built with HTML and Bootstrap.
